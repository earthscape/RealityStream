## Brain Voxels

### The highest resolution brain scans contain 1.2 million voxels.

Each voxel is about 1 cubic millimeter and the average brain is 1,200,000 cubic millimeters.

A voxel is a summary of a brain regions intensity for 1 second.  

Each voxel in the cerebral cortical contains 630,000 neurons, and over 2 million glial cells.

## Deep Learning - A subset of Machine Learning

Both forms of artificial intelligence algorithms contrast with Rule-Based Systems where decisions are manually programmed.  

<b>Machine Learning</b> is the process of using algorithms to parse sets of data (training sets) using pre-defined attributes (features) to predict other sets of data.<br>

<b>Deep Learning</b> is used in layers to create an <b>Artificial Neural Network</b> inspired by the biological neural network of the human brain. “Deep Learning” extracts undefined attributes (features) from raw data (like image pixels or sin waves in audio).<br>

PyTorch and Google JAX are more flexible than Keras. [Keras is training wheels](https://keras.io/): The Python Deep Learning library - TensorFlow Simplified. Keras is now available for JAX, TensorFlow, and PyTorch. TensorFlow could get replaced by JAX.

<b>Both ML and DL have supervised and unsupervised versions</b>

"Supervised learning involves an output label associated with each instance in the dataset. This output can be discrete/categorical or real-valued. Regression models estimate real-valued outputs, whereas classification models estimate discrete-valued outputs.   Simple binary classification models have just two output labels, 1 (positive) and 0 (negative).  Popular supervised learning ML algorithms are linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, support vector machines, and neural networks, as well as non-parametric models such as k-Nearest Neighbors."  

"Unsupervised learning, algorithms such as k-Means, hierarchical clustering, and Gaussian mixture models attempt to learn meaningful structures in the data."

<b>Generative Adversial Networks (GAN)</b> are a form of deep learning in which one side of the network estimates if the other side is correct.
