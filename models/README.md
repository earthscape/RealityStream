## Models

Prior to including data, models are referred to as skeletons or blueprints. Skeletons define the structure and logic of how the model should work prior to loading data. Model skeletons are like having the blueprint of a house without the materials to build it.

**ML Framework:** A framework typically refers to a structured set of tools, libraries, and conventions that provide a foundation for building something. In the case of machine learning, frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, or scikit-learn provide the infrastructure and tools necessary to implement machine learning algorithms. If you have a Python script implementing a Random Forest algorithm but without data, it could be seen as a part of a machine learning framework.
